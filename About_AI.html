			<h2> What is Artificial Intelligence </h2>
				<p>Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence and cognitive functions, such as learning, decision making, problem-solving, speech recognition, translation between languages, and visual acuity.</p>
				<p>A more simple definition for artificial intelligence is that it is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn. </p>
     <br/>
					
			<h2> What is a Robot? </h2>
				<p> A robot is commonly defined as a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by a computer.</p>	
				<br/>
			<h2>What are some available technologies pertaining A.I. and Robots?</h2>
    
				<p><strong>Sophia:</strong> This is a human-like robot which can be implemented to provide social therapy. Sophia was created by Hanson robotics and it can have conversations with humans.</p>

				<p><strong>Erica:</strong> An android implemented in being Japanâ€™s latest news host. According to Hiroshi Ishiguro, director of the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory at Osaka University and Erica's creator, the android will replace a human news anchor on the airwaves as soon as April, the Daily Mail said.</p>

			<h2>What are the potential future uses of a robot with artificial intelligence?</h2>
				<p>The potential future uses of a robot with artificial intelligence are personal, commercial, and recreational.</p>

				<h3>Personal</h3>
					<p>Utilibot can help answer questions with a built in search engine. It can also <br>clean the floor and mow the lawn. Lastly, a surveillance system was <br> made which includes motion detection, machine vision, etc.</p>
						<br/>
					<br/>

				<h3>Commercial</h3>
					
						<p>Robots have many functions that can be used in a work 
setting. Since the robot is programmed with an internal 
GPS, it can serve as a taxi driver of help with any map 
related issues. Furthermore, robots can take the place 
of humans in dangerous jobs such as construction work. 
The benefit of having a robot is the one time cost 
and a few maintenance cost rather than a yearly 
salary which could potentially 
              benefit a company.</p>
						<br/>
					
					<br/>
				<h3>Recreational</h3>
					
						<p>Utilibot has many features that provides entertainment to users. The robot 
is capable of playing games such as chess or checkers. Furthermore, 
the robot can share stories as well as make videos.
            </p>
						
						<br/>
					
					<br/>
    <h3>Research</h3>
     
       <p> In research laboratories, robots can be used to conduct experiments that can be fatal to human health. Additionally, robots can calculate data faster than humans and store more data inside their system.</p>
     <br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
			<h2>What are the future safety concerns of Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
					
						<p>Robots, as advanced as modern technology brings us, are still machines and can malfunction which results in dangerous results. People need to be wary about the possibility of the robots system having a reaction from the circuits or any other malfunction.</p>
